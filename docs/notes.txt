Python project creation:
    # create project dir
    mkdir $PYTHON_WORKSPACE/problem

    # create virtualenv for project
    mkvirtualenv -p python2.7 -a $PYTHON_WORKSPACE/problem problem

    # activate virtualenv workspace
    workon problem

    # to stop working in virtualenv workspace
    deactivate

    # after pulling from git (not abs. necessary in this case)

Procuring a list of words from the internets

    1) get the list of words (assuming you already found a source from github or google):

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sindresorhus/word-list/master/words.txt > words.txt

    2) the list is in alphabetical order so we need to shuffle it:

    perl -MList::Util=shuffle -e 'print shuffle(<STDIN>);' < words.txt  > words_shuf.txt

    3) there were 274925 words in the downloaded list - we need 110k of those:

    tail -110000  words_shuf.txt  > words_shuf_110k.txt


    We end up with the file 'words_shuf_110k.txt' which is unsorted and
    comprised of 110k words.

    We can now use resultant file as the seed file for our program.
